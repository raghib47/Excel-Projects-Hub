## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales performance data for **141 executives** across various regions. The core deliverable is a clean **Excel Dashboard** that summarizes key performance metrics, highlighting top and bottom performers based on their achievement against a universal sales target.

The goal was to transform raw daily sales figures into an insightful report to quickly identify high-performing individuals and those needing support.

## 🎯 Objectives

*   **Data Processing:** To efficiently calculate total sales from daily figures and compute key performance indicators (KPIs).
*   **Performance Analysis:** To measure executive performance against a fixed target of 500 units.
*   **Data Visualization:** To design a straightforward dashboard for quickly identifying top and bottom performers.
*   **Automation:** To utilize Excel formulas for automatic calculation and ranking.

## ⚙️ Features & Technical Implementation

The project demonstrates proficiency in the following Excel functionalities:

*   **Data Aggregation:**
    *   Used `SUM()` functions to calculate **Total Sales** from daily columns (Day1-Day5).
*   **KPI Calculation:**
    *   Used arithmetic formulas to calculate **Target Hit %** (`Total Sales / Target`) and **Away From Target %** (`1 - Target Hit %`).
*   **Dashboard Creation:**
    *   Built a separate dashboard sheet that extracts and displays top and bottom performers using sorting or lookup functions.
*   **Data Organization:**
    *   Managed a dataset of 141+ rows efficiently within Excel.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*   **Total Sales:** Sum of sales from Day 1 to Day 5.
*   **Target Hit %:** Percentage of the 500-unit target achieved.
*   **Away From Target %:** Percentage remaining to meet the target.
